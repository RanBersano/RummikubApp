Points are the face value of each tile. You can’t use other players’ tiles for your first move.\r\n\r\nSets: Run – 3 or more consecutive numbers of the same color (e.g., 4-5-6 blue). Group – 3 or 4 of the same number in different colors (e.g., 7 red, 7 blue, 7 black).\r\n\r\nTurns after starting: Add tiles to existing sets or rearrange sets freely to play tiles from your rack. All sets on the table must remain valid at the end of your turn. If you can’t play, draw one tile from the pool and end your turn.\r\n\r\nJoker Rules:\r\nJokers can replace any tile. If you take a Joker from the table, you must replace it with the exact tile it represents in the same turn.\r\n\r\nWinning:\r\nFirst to empty their rack wins. Others add up their remaining tiles’ values as penalty points.";
